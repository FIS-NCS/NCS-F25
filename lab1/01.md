# Security Auditing

To ensure that an organization complies to a security standard, a **security audit** must be carried (e.g., internally or externally).

> An external audit (e.g., on a yearly basis) is typically carried out by compliance officers as part of the certification process.

## Practice

1. Install [lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/): an open-source CLI tool for security auditing, system hardening, and compliance testing.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install lynis
   ```

2. Run an audit

   ```bash
   sudo lynis audit system 
   ```

3. Inspect the results

## Exercise 1

1. Comment on the results: provide a brief overview on what checks were done  by the tool. You may refer to the [docs](https://cisofy.com/lynis/controls/) for help.

2. Consider two individual checks from different categories for which the results were **not** marked OK (i.e., yellow/red status). Then answer the following for each:
    - What was being checked and why?
    - Why the check didn't result in an OK (green) state?
    - What can be done to fix it?
    - Implement the fix, rerun the scan and verify the state change.
