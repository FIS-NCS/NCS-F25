# Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

SAST involves analyzing source code for security issues and bad practices **without running it**.

- Techniques include pattern matching, traversing ASTs, and taint analysis.

## Practice

1. Clone [Vulpy](https://github.com/fportantier/vulpy): an intentionally-vulnerable Python application

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fportantier/vulpy
    ```

1. Use [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) to run a security scan against the application source code

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-pip
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate.fish
    pip install bandit
    bandit -r vulpy/
    ```

## Exercise 1

> Goal: include the `bandit` scan within your CI/CD process.

1. Clone [PyGoat](https://github.com/adeyosemanputra/pygoat): another intentionally-vulnerable Python application.

1. Remove `.git` directory and re-push the code to a [GitLab](http://gitlab.com/) repository under your account
    > GitLab CI/CD is quite popular for being DevSecOps-focused, providing out-of-the-box templates for SAST, DAST, Secret-Detection, Container Scanning, and related practices.

1. Add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` to your repo to run `bandit` scan against the codebase, generate HTML report, and have the CI runner include it as a pipeline artifact.

1. Test the pipeline, verify it runs on every push to the main branch. Provide proof of the successful run of the pipeline under your account.

1. Check the generated report. Explain two findings and practical steps on how they can be mitigated.
