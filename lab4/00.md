# Endpoint Security

**Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** involves continuosuly monitoring endpoints (e.g., servers, laptops, and IoT devices) to detect and respond to cyber attacks.

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solutions provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by endpoints, applications or networking hardware.

- **Agent:** a lightweight service installed on endpoints (nodes being monitored), it collects and pushes data (e.g., logs) to the server.

- **Server:** main component to process and analyze data received from agents, it supports a cluster mode (master+workers) for larger deployments with large data volumes. It exposes a REST API for interaction.

- **Indexer:** to store and organize data for faster search and retrieval.

- **Dashboard:** frontend for users to query and visualize collected data.
