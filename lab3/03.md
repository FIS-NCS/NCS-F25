# Countermeasures

The rule of thumb in web security is to never trust data from the browser. This includes, but is not limited to data in URL parameters of GET requests, POST requests, HTTP headers and cookies, and user-uploaded files. Always check and sanitize all incoming data. Always assume the worst.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

The [`Content-Security-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) HTTP header provides fine-grained control over the code that can be loaded on a site, and what it is allowed to do.

## Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP)

Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP) is set by the [`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy) response header, which lets websites and applications opt-in to protection against vulnerabilities related to certain cross-origin requests (such as those made by the [`<script>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script) and [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img) elements).

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is handled using [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and related headers. `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` defines the non-same origins that are allowed to make requests to pages on your domain (i.e., via [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) or [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch)).

- By default, [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) blocks cross-origin HTTP requests initiated by scripts. There are several use cases that require cross-origin script access; for example, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) that provide hosting for JavaScript/CSS libraries and public API endpoints. However, cross-origin access presents a major security risk and must be carefully controlled.

## Other Security Measures

- Turning off form autocompletion
- MIME type verification
- Referrer Policy
- `robots.txt` configuration
- Secure Cookie Configuration
- Subresource Integrity
- Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- Secure Contexts
