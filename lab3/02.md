# Exercises

Together with your team, you'll deploy three sample apps locally to practice learned techniques.

It's expected to provide a full-detailed writeup for each discovered vulnerability. This must include:

- Reconnaissance: the actions you took to discover the vulnerability exists.
- Exploits: scripts/code snippets used to perform the attack.
- Proof of work: relevant screenshots of interesting outcomes.

## 1. Python Application

```bash
docker run -it -d --name python-app --network lab_net \
-p 127.0.0.1:7777:7777 --restart unless-stopped innost5/innotva:1.0
```

<details><summary>Spoilers on what to look for</summary>
<ul>
<li> RCE through an OS-command injection</li>
<li> Reflected XSS</li>
<li> SQL Injection</li>
<li> Path Traversal</li>
<li> Unrestricted File Upload (a pre-requisite for more trouble)</li>
<li> Maybe you can find something else?</li>
</ul>
</details><br>

## 2. PHP Application

```bash
docker run -it -d --name php-app --network lab_net \
-p 127.0.0.1:7777:7777 --restart unless-stopped innost5/innowva:1.0
```

## 3. NodeJS Application

```bash
docker run -d --name nodejs-app --network lab_net \
-p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 --restart unless-stopped bkimminich/juice-shop
```
